# JavaMonopoly

Project Description:
Welcome to OOPMonopoly, an innovative Java implementation of the classic Monopoly game designed for the Object-Oriented Programming class. In addition to capturing the essence of Monopoly, this project introduces advanced features that elevate the gaming experience.

Key Features:

Modular Design: Utilizes a modular structure with distinct classes for each game element, fostering code organization and reusability.
Encapsulation: Implements encapsulation to safeguard the integrity of data and restrict access to certain properties, promoting a secure and manageable codebase.
Inheritance: Utilizes inheritance to establish relationships between game entities, enhancing code readability and minimizing redundancy.
Polymorphism: Explores polymorphic behaviors, allowing different classes to be treated as instances of a common base class, facilitating flexibility in implementation.
Added Characteristics:

Advanced Player Movement: Experience an enhanced player movement system that introduces strategic elements to the traditional dice-based progression.
New Deals: Uncover a world of negotiation with the introduction of new deals, allowing players to engage in complex and dynamic trade agreements.
New Buildings: Expand beyond the classic Monopoly properties with the introduction of new buildings, adding a layer of uniqueness to each acquired space.
Regional Map: Immerse yourself in a game set against the backdrop of Spanish communities, as the board reflects a map of distinctive regions, providing a localized twist to the gameplay.
This project not only serves as an exemplary application of Object-Oriented Programming principles but also as an evolution of the classic Monopoly experience, showcasing advanced mechanics and a unique Spanish-themed twist. Dive into the code to explore how OOP principles synergize with innovative gameplay elements in this Java-powered rendition of Monopoly!
