# JavaMonopoly

## Project Description
Welcome to JavaMonopoly, an innovative Java implementation of the classic Monopoly game designed for the Object-Oriented Programming principles.

## Key Features:
- **Modular Design:** Utilizes a modular structure with distinct classes for each game element, fostering code organization and reusability.
- **Encapsulation:** Safeguards data integrity and restricts access to properties, promoting a secure and manageable codebase.
- **Inheritance:** Establishes relationships between game entities, enhancing code readability and minimizing redundancy.
- **Polymorphism:** Explores polymorphic behaviors, allowing different classes to be treated as instances of a common base class, facilitating flexibility in implementation.

## Added Characteristics:
- **Advanced Player Movement:** Experience an enhanced player movement system, introducing strategic elements to the traditional dice-based progression.
- **New Deals:** Uncover a world of negotiation with the introduction of dynamic trade agreements.
- **New Buildings:** Expand beyond classic Monopoly properties, adding a layer of uniqueness to each acquired space.
- **Regional Map:** Immerse yourself in a game set against the backdrop of Spanish communities, with the board reflecting distinctive regions.

This project not only serves as an exemplary application of Object-Oriented Programming principles but also as an evolution of the classic Monopoly experience. Dive into the code to explore how OOP principles synergize with innovative gameplay elements in this Java-powered rendition of Monopoly! ðŸš€âœ¨
